## Getting Started

These instructions will get you running the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

In order to start the API you need to have installed Node and MongoDB on your machine.

### Usage

For starting the development env running, first you have to go to the directory's project where package.json is found and open a terminal.

To install the modules use the command below:

```
npm install
```
After finishing installing you should end up with a node_modules folder inside your project. 

Before starting the node server, you have to start the MongoDB server. To start the node server use the command:
